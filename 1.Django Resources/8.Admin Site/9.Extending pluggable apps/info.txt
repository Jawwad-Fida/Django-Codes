### Extending pluggable apps

# A django application/project is made up of apps. These apps are independent of each other. We keep this so because we can use an individual app 
in a separate app. So we want to build and deploy them independently of each other. 

from tags.models import TaggedItem
--> However, this line creates a dependency between store and tag app. We want to avoid this

So, we will create another app that we will link to both tag and store app. But these app is customed for our project and may not be used elsewhere
store_custom app -> tag and store app

First register the new app in INSTALLED_APPS LIST

python manage.py startapp store_custom

store_custom --> admin.py
