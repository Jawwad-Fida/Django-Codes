## Model forms

a model form is a way to create a form based on a particular model


path('create-project/', views.createProject, name="create-project"), # in urls.py file

# creating urls to views (using url name)
<a href="{% url 'create-project' %}">Add Project</a>

<form action="" method="post">
  <!-- This token ensures that data is clean and not manipulated -->
  {% csrf_token %} # all forms will have this token

  <!--  Django model forms -->
  {{form}}
  <input type="submit" />
</form>



1) form.as_p --> p tag with each field
2) form.title --> show individual field


forms.py

# the model that we are creating the form for
# list of fields that will show on the form.
# fields = '__all__' --> __all__ is a list of all the fields in the model

from django.forms import ModelForm
from .models import Project


class ProjectForm(ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Project
        fields = ['title', 'featured_image', 'description',
                  'demo_link', 'source_link']
